# Multiplication Quiz

This console program asks the user random multiplication questions with operands in the range of 0 to 9. If the user answers correctly,
the program generates a random message of encouragement. If the user answers incorrectly, the program generates a random message
indicating that the answer was incorrect, and allows the user to guess again. The program will continue infinitely unless the user enters -1.
